/**
 * A number is said to be Automorphic number if its square ends in the same digits
 * as the number itself. 
 * 
 * For example, 
 * 
 * 5 and 25 appear at the end of their
 * squares 25 and 625 respectively. Hence, they are automorphic numbers. 
 * 
 * Write a
 * program to accept a number. Pass it to a method that returns the same number of
 * digits from its square as many digits are available in the argument. Finally,
 * display a message whether the number is an automorphic number or not.
